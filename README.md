the idea is to automate the ranking/grading process for Bkb's (replace all with BBP's now) bouldering league.  

this 'app' should do the following:

** REQUIRED
* allow users to log attempts/sends/flashes/zones on bouldering leauge climbs.
* track teams and individuals performances, and calculate winners each league cycle.


** REACH
* automatically determine climbers 'ability level' and track over time for 'most improoved' type statistics.



questions to think about:
- make accessable via mobile app or website?  
- handling secure logins, storing user data, bad user input, etc.
- require bkb's wifi to log attempts?
- notices/alerts to users?
-
